<h2>instructions</h2>

<p>in a rice cooker or pan on the stove, combine 2 cups of broth, rice, half of the garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt. cook and then fluff with a fork and stir in the cilantro. set aside.
using a potato masher, coarsely mash half of the beans with remaining 2/3 cup of broth.
heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium head and add the onion, cooking for about 5 minutes. stir in the tomato paste, cumin, oregano, chile powder and remaining garlic. cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant. add the ground beef, breaking up the meat as it cooks for 8-10 minutes.
add the mashed bean mixture to the beef and cook, stirring occasionally. stir in the lime juice, 1 teaspoon of salt, and remaining whole beans as well as the tomatoes. set aside to cool, about 20 minutes.
wrap the tortillas in a paper towel and microwave for 90 seconds or until pliable. place the tortillas on the counter, divide rice, beef mixture and cheese between each tortilla, fold the ends in and then roll to close. wrap tightly with saran wrap and then foil and freeze each burrito. lasts for about 1 month.
to serve (if you froze them versus eating right away)
turn the oven on to broil. unwrap each burrito, wrap with paper towels and microwave until soft and heated through, about 5 minutes. discard paper towels, top with cheese and broil until melted, 3-5 minutes. serve with sour cream.
